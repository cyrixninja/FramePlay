## Kestra Workflow

FramePlay uses Kestra for orchestrating the video processing workflow. The Kestra workflow is defined in the `kestra_workflow.yml` file and includes the following steps:

1. **Download Video**: Downloads the uploaded video from the specified S3 bucket.
2. **Process Video and Generate Script**: Uses Google Generative AI to analyze the video and generate a travel story script.
3. **Generate Audio**: Converts the generated script into an audio file using AWS Polly.
4. **Merge Video and Audio**: Merges the video with the generated audio using FFmpeg.
5. **Upload Final Video**: Uploads the final video to the specified S3 bucket.

The workflow is triggered by a webhook and ensures that the entire process from video upload to final video generation is automated and efficient.
